# quiz1= what is difference between list and tupe?
# major diffrence list is mutable and tupple is immutable,
#   my_list=[1,2,3,5]
#   my_tupple=(5,6,8,90)
# thats mean store list store element in square bracket and tupple is store element inround bracket.
# Q.2 What is the pass statement in Python?
# There may be times in our code when we haven’t decided what to do yet, but we must type something for it to be syntactically correct. In such a case, we use the pass statement.
# def func(*args):
# pass
# Similarly, the break statement breaks out of a loop.
# >>> for i in range(7):
# if i==3: break
# print(i)
# 1
# 2
# Q.3 How do you get a list of all the keys in a dictionary?
# Be specific in these type of Python Interview Questions and Answers.
# For this, we use the function keys().
# >>> mydict={'a':1,'b':2,'c':3,'e':5}
# >>> mydict.keys()
# Q4. What is a Negative Index in Python?
# Negative numbers mean that you count from the right instead of the left. 
# So, list[-1] refers to the last element, list[-2] is the second-last, and so on.
# Q5.What is type conversion in Python?
# Ans: Type conversion refers to the conversion of one data type into another.
# int() – converts any data type into integer type
# float() – converts any data type into float type
# ord() – converts characters into integer
# hex() – converts integers to hexadecimal
# oct() – converts integer to octal
# tuple() – This function is used to convert to a tuple.
# set() – This function returns the type after converting to set.
# list() – This function is used to convert any data type to a list type.
# dict() – This function is used to convert a tuple of order (key, value) into a dictionary.
# str() – Used to convert integer into a string.
# complex(real,imag) – This function converts real numbers to complex(real,imag) number.
